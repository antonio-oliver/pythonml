# 👋 Welcome to My First Python Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors! 🎉

## Project Overview

This is my first Python project where I have created a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game! 🤖 ✊✋✌️ 

The goal of this project is to:
- Practice basic Python concepts
- Build an interactive command-line game
- Have fun while learning how to structure a Python program!

---

## How to Play 🎮

The rules are simple:
- Choose either **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
- The computer will also make a choice.
- The result is determined based on the classic rules:
  - **Rock beats Scissors**
  - **Scissors beat Paper**
  - **Paper beats Rock**

---

## Getting Started 🚀

To run the **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game on your machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
  - [Download Python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/antonio-oliver/rock-paper-scissors.git
    ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd rock-paper-scissors
    ```

3. **Run the game**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Game Features 🎯

- **Interactive command-line interface**: The game will prompt you to make your choice and display the result.
- **Randomized computer choice**: The computer randomly picks Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- **Win, lose, or draw**: After each round, the result (win, lose, or draw) is displayed.
  
### Future Improvements:
- Adding multiple rounds with a score tracker.
- Enhancing the game with a graphical interface.
- Implementing more game options like **Lizard** and **Spock** for an extended version of the game!

## Example of Gameplay 🎲

When you run the game, you will see something like this:

```bash```
